# Site target list
# - If modifying this list, make sure you limit to 5 websites and use the domain name as shown here
SITES="google.com,facebook.com,twitter.com,youtube.com,amazon.com"

# DNS test site
# - This is the site which is resolved in DNS to test DNS servers, if modified only use one domain name
DNS_TEST_SITE="google.com" # This is the site used in the DNS test

# DNS name servers
# - This is the list of DNS servers which are tested
# - Netprobe only supports 4 DNS servers, you can change the value of "DNS_NAMESERVER_4_IP" to test your own home DNS server
# - Note: do not change the value of "DNS_NAMESERVER_4"
DNS_NAMESERVER_1="Google_DNS"
DNS_NAMESERVER_1_IP="8.8.8.8"
DNS_NAMESERVER_2="Quad9_DNS"
DNS_NAMESERVER_2_IP="9.9.9.9"
DNS_NAMESERVER_3="CloudFlare_DNS"
DNS_NAMESERVER_3_IP="1.1.1.1"
DNS_NAMESERVER_4="My_DNS_Server" # Do not change this line at all!
DNS_NAMESERVER_4_IP="8.8.8.8" # Replace this IP with the DNS server you use at home

# Health Score Weights
# - These are the relative weights used to calculate your 'Internet Quality Score', they can be modified but must add up to 1.0
weight_loss = ".6" # Loss is 60% of score
weight_latency = ".15" # Latency is 15% of score
weight_jitter = ".2" # Jitter is 20% of score
weight_dns_latency = "0.05" # DNS latency is 0.05 of score

# Health Score Thresholds

# - These threshold values are used in the calculation of your 'Internet Quality Score', they can be modified if required
threshold_loss = "5" # 5% loss threshold as max
threshold_latency = "100" # 100ms latency threshold as max
threshold_jitter = "30" # 30ms jitter threshold as max
threshold_dns_latency = "100" # 100ms dns latency threshold as max

# Speetest configuration (be very careful when running on a metered connection!)
# - This configuration is for setting up a "speed test" or rather a test of your internet bandwidth.
# - In order to test your upload and download bandwidth we use speedtest.net as source. So your client will connect there and upload and download some data.
# - That also means that a random server is selected for the test (usually the nearest one)
# - Setting the SPEEDTEST_INTERVAL too agressively will cause speedtest.net to block your requests, recommend 15 minutes (900 seconds) and above
SPEEDTEST_ENABLED="False" # set this to "True" to enable speed test function
SPEEDTEST_INTERVAL="937" # interval on which the speedtest will run, in seconds - note using a prime number helps reduce the number of collisions between netprobe and speed tests
